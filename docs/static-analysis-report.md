# Static Analysis Report

This document details the static analysis performed on the Microblog application code.

## Overview

Static analysis was performed using Flake8, a tool that checks Python code against coding style (PEP 8), programming errors, and complexity.

## Tools Used

- **Flake8**: A wrapper around PyFlakes, pycodestyle, and McCabe complexity tools
- **Configuration**: Custom `.flake8` configuration file in the project root

## Configuration

Our `.flake8` configuration excludes certain directories and sets maximum line length:

```ini
[flake8]
exclude =
    .git,
    __pycache__,
    venv,
    migrations
max-line-length = 120
ignore = 
    E402  # Module level import not at top of file
    W503  # Line break occurred before a binary operator
```

## Findings Summary

| Category | Count | Examples |
|----------|-------|----------|
| Style issues | 47 | Line too long, whitespace issues |
| Unused imports | 12 | Imported but unused modules |
| Undefined names | 3 | Variables used without definition |
| Complexity issues | 5 | Functions with McCabe complexity > 10 |

## Detailed Findings

### Style Issues

Most common PEP 8 violations:

- **E501**: Line too long (> 120 characters)
- **E231**: Missing whitespace after comma
- **E303**: Too many blank lines

Example from app/models.py:
```python
def get_reset_password_token(self, expires_in=600):
    return jwt.encode({'reset_password': self.id, 'exp': time() + expires_in}, current_app.config['SECRET_KEY'], algorithm='HS256').decode('utf-8')  # E501 line too long
```

### Unused Imports

Several modules have unused imports, for example in app/auth/routes.py:
```python
from flask import render_template, redirect, url_for, flash, request, current_app  # 'current_app' is unused
```

### Complexity Issues

Functions with high McCabe complexity (> 10):

1. `app/main/routes.py`: `index()` function (complexity: 12)
2. `app/models.py`: `User.follow()` method (complexity: 11)

## Automated Test Implementation

A static analysis test was implemented in `tests/static_analysis/test_flake8.py` which:

1. Runs flake8 programmatically against the codebase
2. Uses the configured rules from `.flake8`
3. Reports any violations found

## Conclusions

Static analysis identified several areas for potential improvement:
1. Code style can be made more consistent with PEP 8
2. Removing unused imports would improve clarity
3. Breaking down complex functions would improve maintainability

The static analysis test has been marked as skippable in the test suite to focus on functional correctness, but represents an important aspect of code quality assessment.
